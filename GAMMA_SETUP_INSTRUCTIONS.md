# Setup Instructions for Gamma Integration

To use the "Send to Gamma" feature, you must first securely set your Gamma API key. This is a one-time setup process.

## Steps

1.  **Open the Apps Script Project:**
    *   Open the Google Doc where you want to use the integration.
    *   Go to `Extensions > Apps Script`. This will open the script editor in a new tab.

2.  **Select the "Set Gamma API Key" Menu Item:**
    *   Go back to your Google Doc.
    *   A new menu named "Gamma Tools" should now be visible.
    *   Click `Gamma Tools > Set Gamma API Key`.

3.  **Enter Your API Key:**
    *   A prompt dialog will appear with the title "Set Gamma API Key".
    *   Paste your valid Gamma API key (it should start with `sk-gamma-...`) into the text box.
    *   Click **OK**.

4.  **Authorization (First Time Only):**
    *   If this is your first time running the script, Google will ask for authorization.
    *   Follow the on-screen prompts to grant the necessary permissions to the script. This may require you to select your Google account and approve the permissions.

5.  **Confirmation:**
    *   You should see a confirmation message ("SUCCESS: Gamma API Key has been set.") indicating that the key has been stored securely.

Your Gamma API key is now set up, and you can start using the "Send to Gamma" feature.
