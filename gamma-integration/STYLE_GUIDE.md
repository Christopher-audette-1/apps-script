# Advanced Gamma Presentation Outline Style Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to format your Google Doc to generate highly specific and beautifully designed presentations using the Gamma API.

## The Basics: Structure and Content

The script works by converting your Google Doc's formatting into a markdown-like text that the Gamma API can understand. Here's how to control the basic structure of your presentation:

*   **Presentation Title:** The first line of your document should be the main title of your presentation. Use the **Title** style in Google Docs for this.
*   **Slide Breaks:** To create a new slide, insert a **Horizontal Rule** from the "Insert" menu in Google Docs.
*   **Slide Titles and Subtitles:**
    *   Use **Heading 1** for the main title of a slide.
    *   Use **Heading 2** for subtitles or section headers within a slide.
*   **Bulleted Lists:** Use standard Google Docs bullet points to create lists. The script will automatically convert them into markdown lists.
*   **Paragraphs:** Normal text will be treated as paragraphs.

## Advanced Control with "Detailed Instructions"

The "Detailed Instructions" field in the "Send to Gamma" dialog gives you powerful, natural-language control over the style and layout of your presentation. Here are some examples of what you can do:

### Overall Presentation Style

*   **Tone and Audience:** "Make the tone of this presentation professional and inspiring. The target audience is a group of potential investors."
*   **Visual Style:** "Use a minimalist black and white theme." or "I want a vibrant and colorful design with a modern feel."
*   **Image Style:** "All images should be photorealistic." or "Use line art for all images."

### Slide-Specific Layouts

You can even specify the layout for particular slides. For example:

*   "For the slide titled 'Our Team', create a three-column layout with a picture of each team member."
*   "Make the 'Financial Projections' slide a full-bleed image with the title in the lower-left corner."

### Image Control

*   **Image Placement:** "Place the company logo in the top-right corner of every slide except the title slide."
*   **Image Galleries:** "Group the last 10 images into a gallery to showcase them together."
*   **Using Your Own Images:** You can insert image URLs directly into your Google Doc on their own line. To prevent Gamma from generating additional images, you can add an instruction like: "Only use the images I have provided in the document."

## Example of a Well-Formatted Outline

Here is an example of a Google Doc outline that uses these principles:

**[Title] My Startup Pitch**

---

**[Heading 1] Introduction**

*   Welcome to the future of...
*   Our mission is to revolutionize the...

---

**[Heading 1] The Problem**

**[Heading 2] The Market is Underserved**

The current solutions are outdated and inefficient...

By combining the structured formatting of the Google Doc with the power of the "Detailed Instructions," you can create highly specific and professional-looking presentations with ease.
