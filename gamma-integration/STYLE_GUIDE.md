# Gamma Presentation Outline Style Guide

To get the best results when sending your Google Doc outline to Gamma, follow these formatting guidelines.

## 1. Presentation Title

The first line of your document should be the title of your presentation. Use a **Title** style for this line.

## 2. Slide Separation

To indicate the beginning of a new slide, use a horizontal rule (`---`) on its own line.

## 3. Slide Titles

Each slide should have a title. Use a **Heading 2** style (or start the line with `##`) for the slide title.

## 4. Slide Content

- **Bullet Points:** Use standard bullet points (like `-` or `*`) for lists.
- **Paragraphs:** Write paragraphs as you normally would.

## 5. Speaker Notes

To add speaker notes to a slide, add a section at the end of the slide's content that starts with `Notes:`. Everything after this line will be treated as speaker notes and will not be visible on the slide.

## 6. Images

This script does not support embedding images from the Google Doc into the Gamma presentation. You can add images later in the Gamma editor.

## Example

Here is an example of a well-formatted outline:

```
# My Awesome Presentation

---

## Slide 1: Introduction

- This is the first bullet point.
- This is the second bullet point.

Notes: Remember to smile!

---

## Slide 2: The Main Point

This is a paragraph explaining the main point of the presentation.

- You can also have bullet points here.
- And another one.

Notes: Don't talk too fast.
```
