# Gamma Presentation Outline Style Guide

This guide explains how to structure your Google Doc to create presentations with the "Send to Gamma" script.

## Document Structure

The script relies on the structure of your Google Doc to create the slides. Here's how to format your document:

*   **Presentation Title:** The first line of your document should be the main title of your presentation. Use the **Title** style in Google Docs for this.
*   **Slide Breaks:** To create a new slide, insert a **Horizontal Rule** from the "Insert" menu in Google Docs.
*   **Slide Titles and Subtitles:**
    *   Use **Heading 1** for the main title of a slide.
    *   Use **Heading 2** for subtitles or section headers within a slide.
*   **Bulleted Lists:** Use standard Google Docs bullet points to create lists.
*   **Paragraphs:** Normal text will be treated as paragraphs.

## Preset Instructions

This template includes preset "Detailed Instructions" that control the overall style and layout of the presentation. These instructions are automatically loaded when you run the "Send to Gamma" script.

### Editing the Preset Instructions

To edit the preset instructions for this template:

1.  Scroll to the bottom of this document.
2.  The preset instructions are all the text that appears *after* the very last horizontal rule.
3.  You can edit this text to change the default instructions for this template.

When you run the "Send to Gamma" script, you will see these preset instructions in the dialog. You can override them at that time if you want to make a one-off change.

## Example

Make the tone of this presentation professional and inspiring. The target audience is a group of potential investors. Use a minimalist black and white theme. All images should be photorealistic.
