# Gamma Presentation Outline Style Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to format your Google Doc for the best results when using the "Send to Gamma" feature. The script is designed to parse a structured document, so following these guidelines will ensure that your presentation is generated correctly.

## Document Structure

The script reads the content of your Google Doc and sends it to Gamma. To ensure the content is parsed correctly, we recommend structuring your document with clear headings and lists.

### Headings

Use headings to define the structure of your presentation. Each major section of your presentation should start with a **Heading 1**. Subsections should use **Heading 2**, **Heading 3**, and so on.

**Example:**

# My Presentation Title (Heading 1)

## Introduction (Heading 2)

### The Problem (Heading 3)

### The Solution (Heading 3)

## Main Body (Heading 2)

...

### Content Formatting

Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize your content within each section. This will help Gamma to create a well-structured presentation.

**Example:**

## Introduction (Heading 2)

* This is the first point of my introduction.
* This is the second point.

### The Problem (Heading 3)

1. This is the first problem.
2. This is the second problem.

## Image Placeholders

To include images in your presentation, you can use placeholders in your text. The script will recognize these placeholders and you can then replace them with images in Gamma.

**Example:**

`[Image: A chart showing a downward trend]`

## Speaker Notes

To add speaker notes to a slide, use a blockquote.

**Example:**

> Speaker Note: Make sure to emphasize this point.

## Summary of Best Practices

*   Use **Heading 1** for the main title of your presentation.
*   Use **Heading 2**, **Heading 3**, etc., to structure your content.
*   Use bullet points or numbered lists for the content within each section.
*   Use `[Image: description]` to indicate where an image should be placed.
*   Use blockquotes for speaker notes.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Google Doc is easily converted into a beautiful and well-structured presentation in Gamma.
