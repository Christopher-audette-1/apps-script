# Gamma Integration Style Guide

This document outlines the best practices for formatting your Google Doc presentation outlines to ensure the best results when sending them to Gamma.

## Presentation Structure

-   **Title:** The title of your presentation should be formatted as a `Heading 1`.
-   **Slide Titles:** Each new slide should begin with a `Heading 2`.
-   **Subtitles:** Subtitles within a slide should be formatted as `Subtitle` (which will be converted to a `###` markdown heading).
-   **Slide Breaks:** A horizontal rule (`---`) will also create a new slide.

## Content Formatting

-   **Body Text:** Normal paragraph text will be treated as the body content for each slide.
-   **Lists:** Bulleted and numbered lists are supported.
-   **Footnotes:** To add footnotes, use the standard markdown syntax. In your slide content, add a reference like `[^1]`, and then define the footnote at the end of the slide's content with `[^1]: Your footnote text.`.

## Final Output

Once the Gamma presentation is generated, two links will be added to the header of your Google Doc:

-   **View Presentation:** A link to view the generated Gamma presentation.
-   **Download:** A link to download the presentation (if available).
